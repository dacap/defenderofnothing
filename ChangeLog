	* src/media.cpp, media/bedevil.dat, src/player.cpp: Drawn the main
	character, with movements to all sides and a couple of "fire"
	animations. Also drawn the tail movement. Created the
	datafile. Added the graphics to the player.

	* src/gameplay.cpp: input, player, level, screenshot. The only code
	reutilized from other project (http://vaca.sourceforge.net/) is
	vector2d. All the "look-at" and scroll movement was made.

	* src/main.cpp (game_loop): Done the main game loop. And the base
	classes: Game, GameState, Control. I'm very happy: I didn't make
	any copy & paste :)
