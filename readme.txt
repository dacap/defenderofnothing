 SpeedHack Rules
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Evilness:
    You can send people to Hell (burning them), but it's not the
    objective (anyway you will get points for that).
  * Radius of Influence:
    The burning effect of the devil with the people.
  * Get a Grip:
    INCOMPLETE (...It should be: The friction of cars with the floor. And
    when you smash angels on the street.)
  * Ratio, Respect!
    The game support widescreen resolution and a square aspect one, to
    switch one to another press F11.
  * Reverse Stereotypes:
    Angels that want to kill people to send them to heaven, and a
    Devil that defend people. Angels with glasses. And a God that
    you wouldn't want to known (INCOMPLETE).
  * Dialogue:
    Thanks to the "Act of Generosity" rule, I threw away the Dialogue rule.

  Another important note: all files and graphics were made between the
  3 days period of competition. There are only one file that wasn't
  coded during the 3 days period, and it's:

    include/vector2d.hpp (I took it from an example of my Vaca library)

  (that linear algebra never changes :)

the people, anyway, extra points will give you if you send people to
Hell to keep them more safe.
