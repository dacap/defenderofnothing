 SpeedHack Rules
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Evilness:
    You control a devil that must to beat angels, and send the people
    to Hell.
  * Radius of Influence:
    The burning effect of the devil with the scenary.
  * Get a Grip:
    The friction of the cars with the floor. And when you smash angels
    on the street.
  * Ratio, Respect!
    The game support widescreen resolution by default and can be
    configured (through Setup menu) to use a fullscreen mode.
  * Reverse Stereotypes:
    Angels that want to kill people to send them to heaven because
    the Heaven is getting empty.
  * Dialogue:
    Thanks to the "Act of Generosity" rule, I threw away the Dialogue rule.

  Another important, the files that weren't coded during the 3 days
  period are:

    include/vector2d.hpp (I took it from an example of my Vaca library)
